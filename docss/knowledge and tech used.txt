Great clarity on your current knowledge. You already have strong foundations in core ML, supervised/unsupervised algorithms, activation functions, and deep learning models with backpropagation. For building VeriFact and general advanced AI apps like this, hereâ€™s what you need to focus on next, in logical order:

âœ… 1. Transformers & LLM Fundamentals (if not covered practically)
Understand: Encoder-decoder architecture, self-attention, positional encoding.

Practice: Loading and using pre-trained transformer models via Hugging Face.

Goal: Comfort with embeddings, tokenization, prompt engineering, and model outputs.

âœ… 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Understand RAG theory: Combining dense retrieval with generation for grounded responses.

Key parts:\n - Vector databases: (FAISS, Chroma) â€“ storing embeddings for fast similarity search.\n - Embeddings: Generating them using models like BERT, Sentence Transformers.\n - Retriever-Reader pipeline: Using LangChain or Haystack to orchestrate retrieval + generation.\n\nðŸ”– Learn:\n- RAG implementation basics (Hugging Face RAG docs, LangChain tutorials)\n- When to use vs. standard LLM prompting\n\nðŸ“Œ Why important here: VeriFact must retrieve real evidence from Wikipedia/news before generating verdicts.

âœ… 3. LangChain
Understand LangChainâ€™s modular design: Chains, Agents, Tools, Memory.

Practice:\n - Building a simple retrieval QA chain.\n - Connecting to external APIs and vector stores.\n - Using LangChainâ€™s prompt templates effectively.\n\nðŸ”– Learn:\n- LangChain docs quickstart and RAG pipelines.\n- Sample projects (e.g. document QA, summarization chains).

âœ… 4. Vector Databases
FAISS: Local, high-speed vector database for embeddings.\n- Chroma: Serverless alternative, integrates easily with LangChain.\n\nðŸ”– Learn:\n- How to create an index, add vectors, query by similarity.\n- Trade-offs between FAISS (fast, local) and cloud stores (Weaviate, Pinecone).

âœ… 5. Prompt Engineering
Practice writing effective prompts for verdict generation.\n- Focus on:\n - Combining multiple retrieved snippets into one prompt.\n - Formatting outputs for clarity and citations.

âœ… Optional: Advanced (For Future)
Fine-tuning models (RAG or LLM) for domain-specific accuracy.\n- Serving quantized models locally using llama.cpp for cost savings.\n- LangGraph (LangChain extension) for complex multi-step workflows.
