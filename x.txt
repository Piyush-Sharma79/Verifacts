neumorphism, minimalism, and playful organic design. Here's a detailed breakdown of their characteristics so you can guide Stitch or any design AI effectively:

🔷 Overall Design Style
Minimal yet expressive

Large whitespace for focus

Sparse layout without clutter

Rounded shapes and cards

Soft edges on containers and elements

Playful, humanised feel

Sticky notes, doodles, and emoji-like icons (first and third images)

Subtle textures or noise backgrounds

Adds warmth and tactility (third image especially)

🖋️ Typography
Large, bold headings with clean sans-serif fonts

Mixed font weights for hierarchy (e.g. bold headline, thin subheadline)

Occasional playful or rounded fonts (third image)

🎨 Color palette
Mostly neutral (white, grey, off-white) backgrounds

Accent colours used sparingly (blue buttons, green highlights)

Pastel or muted tones for a calm, professional look

🧩 Visual elements & layout
Centralised hero text with CTA button underneath

Product screenshots or UI previews slightly tilted or floating

Illustrations/icons integrated organically with content

Soft shadows for depth (neumorphism influence)

🔗 Buttons & CTAs
High-contrast, rounded buttons

Often primary CTA in accent colour (blue, green) and secondary in neutral tone

📐 Grid & alignment
Clean vertical flow with sections stacked clearly

Asymmetrical placements to add dynamic feel (e.g. images partially out of container)

Sticky note and paper motifs = approachable and relatable

Integrated UI elements like reminders, integrations

Very neumorphic icons with shadows




Serious, enterprise tone with dark green palette

Human photos with arrows pointing = team-centric, trusted

Grid background for structure and confidence





Very playful: emoji icons, irregular cutout shapes

Textured paper background adds personality


Asymmetric typography with overlapping images
