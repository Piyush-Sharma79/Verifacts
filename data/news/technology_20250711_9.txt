Theory is that mop-capable robot vacuums are a great idea, but in application, the performance doesn’t nearly equal real cleaning ability. The majority of models leave dust, dirt or streaks behind which can be disheartening when you desire floors to be gleaming clean.
That’s where the eufy E25 Omni robot vacuum and mop combo is good at: With industrial-grade suction power, it ensures your floors are left immaculate after every clean. Few brands offer anything close to the 20,000Pa of suction that eufy delivers here, which makes it a rare find for those who want professional-level results at home.
For Prime Day, this model is available at an all-time low price, but you’ll need to be a Prime member to claim the deal on Amazon: It has fallen to a mere $699, from its regular price of $1,199 and that’s a staggering 42% discount on this model.

What sets the eufy E25 Omni apart is its 20,000Pa Turbo Suction which competes with professional cleaning equipment. This level of suction enables it to pick up even the most embedded dirt and dander from carpets and hard floors. The HydroJet mopping system then fills in the vacuuming by scrubbing and cleaning your floors to leave them with a deep-down clean below the surface dust. The zero-tangle brush style is also a huge advantage for pet or long hair families as it does not permit hair to curl around the brush and needs less upkeep.
Edge-to-corner deep cleaning is another feature highlight of the E25 Omni: Its advanced sensors and mapping technology allow it to clean into corners and along edges where dirt accumulates. The obstacle avoidance feature keeps it from bumping into furniture and other objects with which it shares your house so that you needn’t worry about it getting stuck or missing spots.
Among the most low-maintenance is the all-in-one station, auto-emptying and self-cleaning: When each cleaning cycle is complete, the robot returns to its charger, empties the dustbin and cleans itself which means you can do a tremendous amount of hands-off maintenance. This saves a massive amount of time and means you can go (up to 7) weeks without ever laying hands on the vacuum.
If you’re looking for a robot vacuum that delivers industrial-grade cleaning, the eufy E25 Omni is the clear winner. With its current Prime Day price, there’s never been a better time to upgrade your cleaning routine.
