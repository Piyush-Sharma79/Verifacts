Biomni is a general-purpose biomedical AI agent designed to autonomously execute a wide range of research tasks across diverse biomedical subfields. By integrating cutting-edge large language model (LLM) reasoning with retrieval-augmented planning and code-based execution, Biomni helps scientists dramatically enhance research productivity and generate testable hypotheses.
Our software environment is massive and we provide a single setup.sh script to setup.
Follow this file to setup the env first.
Then activate the environment E1:
then install the latest biomni package:
Or install from the github source version.
Lastly, configure your API keys in bash profile ~/.bashrc:
Once inside the environment, you can start using Biomni:
Biomni is an open-science initiative that thrives on community contributions. We welcome:
Check out this Contributing Guide on how to contribute to the Biomni ecosystem.
If you have particular tool/database/software in mind that you want to add, you can also submit to this form and the biomni team will implement them.
Biomni-E1 only scratches the surface of what’s possible in the biomedical action space.
Now, we’re building Biomni-E2 — a next-generation environment developed with and for the community.
We believe that by collaboratively defining and curating a shared library of standard biomedical actions, we can accelerate science for everyone.
Join us in shaping the future of biomedical AI agent.
Let’s build it together.
