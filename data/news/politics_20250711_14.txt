Andy May’s 2020 book, Politics & Climate Change: A History, is picking up renewed attention — and for good reason. Dr. Patrice Poyet has released a freshly updated, in-depth review that’s now available on ResearchGate.
The reason for the uptick in interest? The wheels have finally come off the “dangerous climate change” myth. As that narrative collapses, people are hungry to understand the decades of corruption that fueled it — and to hear the stories of the men and women who stood their ground. The usual suspects? Greenpeace, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Al Gore, Raúl Grijalva, Tom Steyer, Naomi Oreskes, Peter Frumhoff — all deeply entangled in this multi-billion dollar machine. But now that the playing field is leveling, their tactics and motives are under a brighter light.
Poyet’s review pays particular attention to the business of climate alarmism — and yes, it is a business. Billions have been shoveled into the myth by Steyer, Bloomberg, and the rest of the so-called “Billionaires Club,” backed by organizations like the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Hewlett Foundation, the Packard Foundation, the Schmidt Family Foundation, Sea Change, Park Foundation, and the Marisla Foundation. The House Science Committee has even linked Sea Change to Russian funding, aimed at stopping fracking in America by laundering influence through environmental groups.
Greenpeace, meanwhile, didn’t miss a beat. They adapted to the new funding ecosystem, crafting “activism” campaigns that smeared reputable scientists like Will Happer and Willie Soon, spinning up outright fabrications and handing them off to sympathetic media allies.
The review also reminds us of the price paid by those who stood for scientific integrity: Willie Soon, Scott Pruitt, Judith Curry, David Legates, John Christy, Roy Spencer, Robert Balling, Roger Pielke Jr., Roger Pielke Sr., Steven Hayward, Will Happer, Richard Lindzen, Anthony Watts, Steve McIntyre, Ross McKitrick, Greg Wrightstone, Marcel Crok, the late, great Tim Ball — and many others who’ve taken more than their fair share of slings and arrows for daring to speak the truth.
Take a look at Poyet’s review. If it resonates, grab the book — it’s available on Amazon, Kobo, and Barnes & Noble. It’s well worth your time.

Willie Soon stood for scientific integrity? Is this parody?
Willie Soon is a disgrace to climate skeptics…
4 of his main lies:
1) Global warming is primarily caused by solar activity, not human-produced greenhouse gases, relying heavily on the flawed Hoyt and Schatten 1993 TSI series.
2) The 20th century was not a uniquely extreme climatic period.
3) CO2 does not significantly contribute to climate change and is not a problem.
4) Methane does not contribute to global warming, citing Titan’s cold climate.
wake up peeps, rallying behind liars like Willie Soon is only for fake skeptics.
Let’s see if the big brother will let this message pass and it won’t get censored once again…
Your opinion is noted, and rejected, at least by me.
It looks to me like you are the one who is making claims he can’t back up.
Big Brother let you speak. And you embarrassed yourself.
There is no need for skeptics to rally around Willie Soon, or anyone else, because the facts speak for themselves, and the facts say there is no evidence that CO2 is doing what Climate Alarmists claim it is doing.  No evidence.  You are invited to provide some if you have any.  I won’t hold my breath waiting.
I love your projection pal, I can back up everything… can you?
but if you think Willie Soon has scientific integrity then you live in a fantasy world.
Let’s see,
Scientific sources discrediting Willie Soon for all above points:

Let’s see what you’ve got, except from pseudoscientific messiahs
J.K., have you ever read the unabashed alarmism that your info source, the AMS, spruiks about climate change?
This is ideology / religion, pure and simple –
https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/about-ams/ams-and-climate-change/
Inability to engage in what I said. Said like a cultist that knows doesn’t want to know what scientists say.
Prove me wrong pal by checking the above sources.
Mate, the cult in play in all this is the “CO2 climate control knob” religion.
In which you are obviously an acolyte.
That control knob must have been on the fritz when it was turned up to 11 on several occasions in the past, and Earth sailed on serenely on its solar cycles, heatin’ up and coolin’ down as it went.
Maybe the CO2 climate control knob is really just one of those like they put on the kindergarten toys for the bubs to twirl around and chuckle away at?
you call them cult, yet I haven’t found a single person here willing to have some critical thinking and discuss it. you all start knowing that there is no climate change and without having any idea what I posted you just deny it. That is not skepticism, what you are doing is just plain cultist denial… pitiful really.
“you all start knowing that there is no climate change”
Absolutely false. If that is what you think/believe, then your reading comprehension is nil.
Your definition of critical thinking is obviously anyone who agrees with what you posts is willing to have some critical thinking and anyone who disagrees is a cultist.
You are not applying skepticism to your own comments.
J K,
In science, it is rare to prove one wrong because the right answer is seldom known. We do most research to improve or question the current accepted wisdom. Rarely, there is a clear outcome, such as Drs Marshall & Warren showing ulcers were caused by bacteria. The big edifice of climate change research has not yielded such clear cases and remains a battleground of conflicting opinion, with an overall poor standard of science causing enormous numbers of “he said, she said” arguments. To be fair, Earth lacks a twin for comparative science, which complicates matters.
It has always been unwise for scientists to select and promote a particular outcome unless there are clear reasons. The present status of climate research is quite unclear, partly because many researchers have adopted an outcome before it is clear. The data on past climates, both measured (poorly) and by proxies (usually with large, unstated uncertainty) allows a lot of opinion. Opinion matters little in the face of reality – and in reality, most past expert climate change forecasts to a stated date now passed, have been failures.    Geoff S
Attitude and an inability to use any data except from alarmists.  Keep on discrediting yourself.
Sounds like the death throes of a 1980s “peep” who finally got DOGEd, or Big Beautiful Billed this week. About time, if so.
….. or Willie Soon did his wife.
The time it took you to think this response you could have read all the links I ashared to trhink why am I saying this, to see what scientists publish and the things that Willie Soon is lying to you. But then again if this is your unswer, what I posted is probably way above your paygrade
You accept conclusions based on the logical fallacy of appeal to authority. Peer review is no longer proof of verification and validation and has been in a dismal state for many years, especially in the age of publish or perish..
WUWT is a pioneer and I think they’ve discovered a new syndrome – WSDS, Willie Soon Derangement Syndrome.
Your links are sh!t, and your arguments are 10 years past their sell-by date. You can’t back anything up – you’re just one of the regular blowhards that comes and goes on this site frequently.
Go.
you say that 2024 is 10 years past… I can’t argue with denier math…
It’s exhilarating seeing you all try to come up with your best response to my complete obliteration of Willie Soon’s lies, and what’s the best you can come up? That 2024 is 10 years old…
You are geniuses….
J K,
So much misinformation, so little time:
Chatzistergos’ paper is nonsense and anyway attacks the wrong Hoyt and Schatten TSI reconstruction, the one Soon used is Scafetta’s 2019 TSI.
No one knows what the correct TSI record is, some choose the PMOD reconstruction and some choose the ACRIM, but no one knows, see here:
https://andymaypetrophysicist.com/2020/04/18/ipcc-politics-and-solar-variability/
And, even if we know what TSI was, that doesn’t mean we know how it affects climate. See Haigh (2011, Solar Influences on Climate).
As for recent weather being unusual, it is well documented by Severinghaus, et al. (1998) that the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth warmed 5-10 deg. C in just a few decades after the end of the Younger Dryas about 11,700 years ago. That is unusual, one degree in 170 years is not unusual, particularly after the end of the Little Ice Age. Warming more abrupt than the past 170 years is well documented many times throughout the Holocene.
The Lacis papers on the “Principal Control Knob” crap are nonsense and unsupported by the facts. All they or the IPCC have are models which have never been validated and have never successfully predicted anything.
If there is a “control knob” it is water, water vapor, clouds, and ice. It isn’t CO2 and even the most ardent of alarmists generally agree with that. See here:
https://andymaypetrophysicist.com/2024/06/04/all-things-equal/
You are way off base on methane. The methane part of the spectrum is already blocked by water vapor absorption, methane can’t do anything because water vapor has already absorbed its frequencies. see attached. Most idiots just look at data for methane and forget that in the atmosphere we have other GHGs that absorb the same frequencies.
oh boy what a nonsense answer by someone who clearly does not know what he is talking about…
Scafetta simply connected the Hoyt and Schatten 1993 model to the ACRIM composite… Scafetta was lazy or unable to reproduce the model.
Dr. Chatzistergos’ criticism completely obliterated the entire thesis of Soon/Connolly/Scafetta
If you had taken the time to exercise critical thinking and not the typical climate denier close minded braindead unthinking you would have realised that Dr. Chatzistergos’ results were compared to all composites and he gave the results in a way that they are correct irrespectiely of which composite is correct. Pick ACRIM as the correct one, it actually makes it even worse for Soon…
Moving the goal post for comment 2.
Deflecting for 3 and you are completely wrong about methane.
If you had checked the paper I linked you would have even noticed that it has an update where methane’s effect is now more correctly estiamted as 25% higher than previously thought.
but you don’t care about science, you are another fossilfuel shill whose whole mission is to make propaganda.
I love CO2
My suggestion to open the window from time to time, too much CO2 impairs brain activity. Just saying, y’all CO2 loving peeps, don’t overdo it with CO2, it can seriously harm you.
Tell that to the submariners.
We exhale 20,000 ppm of CO2 with each breath.
Greenhouses up CO2 to 1500 ppm and higher to enhance plant growth.
Submarines limit CO2 to 5000 ppm but have been measured as high as 11,300 ppm.
A typical living room is considered “safe” at 1000 ppm.
Your bedroom, with the windows closed while you are sleeping can get to 4500 ppm.
My suggestion is for you to open your mind.
It really amazes me how little science your average alarmist acolyte actually knows.
Me, too.  I can’t get enough!
As usual, nothing but bluster and insult.
Typical alarmist.
If you choose to ignore that I posted several scientific works to explain why Willie’s Soon’s thesis is crap and you stick to my responses to ignorant comments then you are still wrong, but….
Here it is again, prove me wrong when I say that none of you is really a skeptic and read them. I know you won’t bother to read science because you don’t care about science, you are just in a cult

Let’s see what you’ve got, except from pseudoscientific messiahs
Poor fool, he’s just another acolyte who believes that if he posts the same links to disproven studies enough times, those links will somehow, magically, become relevant.
MarkW says…
“As usual, nothing but bluster and insult.”
Then he says…
“Poor fool, he’s just another acolyte…”
That made me laugh.
JK has his mind made up, and no one is going to change it.
Rigid Religious Beliefs cause this reaction in some people.  They absorb the dogma, in this case, the CO2 dogma, and that’s the end of the story as far as they are concerned.
Said Tom, apparently without irony… lol!
Another acolyte who actually believes the propaganda it pushes qualifies as science.
Ah. Another logical fallacy. Insults to silence.
Let’s also point out that water vapor is 500,000 ppb to 5,000,000 ppb while methane is < 1940 ppb. For every 1 CH4 molecule interacting with whatever, there are 250 to 2500 H2O interacting.
Here is a point-by-point rebuttal to Chatzistergos, T. (2024):
https://andymaypetrophysicist.com/2023/07/04/a-twitter-debate-on-clintels-ipcc-ar6-critique/
Summary:
Chatzistergos inability to see the difference between opposing opinions and actual mistakes is not surprising given the appalling level of scientific training today and the politicization of climate science. That is why I took the time to write this post defending our book.
His tweets confuse facts with opinions. This is also commonly seen in supposed “fact checks” by Climate Feedback and other organizations of that ilk, as we discuss here. Clearly our universities are not training our young scientists very well, this is a real problem that should be addressed.
You rebutted in your blog a paper Dr. Chatzistergos published a year later?
So not only you are complitely ignorant (since you obviously have no idea what I am saying here) you claim to have magical abilities, a foresight.. you know everything scientists are going to publish in the future too and you already know you deny them…
And this is exactly my point. Cultist mentality. You don’t even bother to read what I post, you don’t even care to understand this topic. You just know you have to
And let me laugh at you for thinking that you outsmarted a credible scientist, when you are compeltely unable to respond coherently to me in this blog…
I start to see how lost a cause climate skepticism is when people like you and Willie Soon make such noise with crap. You are the reasons climate skeptics are treated as deniers, because you Andy May are nothing more than an ignorant denier who knows nothing and can’t even be bothered to learn
Calling Andy May “completely stupid” just shows how little you really know.
You are the Cultist.
Skepticism is winning the CO2 wars in case you hadn’t noticed.
There is still no evidence that CO2 causes the Earth’s climate to change in any way, shape, or form.
As complex as Earth’s multiple coupled energy systems are, there absolutely cannot be a single (or any) control knob.
One can consider the sun as a “control knob” but it is not singular nor exclusive even though it is the dominant energy source for life on earth.
I’ll ignore the juvenile insults for now. First of all, the paper you cited was very flawed and Chatzistergos had to correct it three times (30 May, 9 May, and 19 March, 2024), it is hard to even find a fully corrected version he made so many mistakes the first time around. The paper I criticize here:
https://andymaypetrophysicist.com/2023/07/04/a-twitter-debate-on-clintels-ipcc-ar6-critique/
Is from 2023, but makes similar points, plus it is a better paper. The 2024 paper is awful and hardly worth discussing. It confuses opinions and facts and makes absurd and unjustifiable assertions. Your comments here confuse Hoyt & Schatten, 1993 with Scafetta, 2019 and they are not the same. HS93 was an excellent paper 32 years ago when it was published, but of course we have more data now and were it redone it would be better. Chatzistergos (2024) is not only very flawed, but juvenile.
The key problems you have and have not seen yet I guess, are:
1. No one knows what the correct TSI reconstruction of satellite data is over time, either in the satellite era or before. Both Chatzistergos (2023) and all of Soon’s papers acknowledge this simple fact.
2.Even if we knew what the TSI record was, we would not know its impact on climate (Haigh, 2011).
The frequency distribution of solar output changes as the Sun changes, and different frequencies have different impacts on climate. You can’t make any judgements on TSI alone with respect to climate, even if you knew what TSI was, which we don’t.
Let me get this straight, is it an opinion that Hoyt and Schatten made up data for 10 years after their paper was published?
Is it an opinion that Hoyt and Schatten moved some data back in time so that they could match temperatures?
The fact that a paper got minor corrections does not mean the results are wrong… And… it literally means that issues were correccted…
Chatzistergos et al. 2023 acknowledges the situation with various recent reconstructions, Soon pushes for old and flawed MODELS to be considered the BEST estimates we have, that is after they lie to you about them not being models….
I will say it again for you pal, again to show your ignorance.
Scafetta did nothing more than connect Hoyt and Schatten 1993 MODEL to ACRIM. Dr. Chatzistergos by demonstrating the manipulation Hoyt did to his model completely invalidates Soon’s claim.
Read this lovely text from Dr. Chatzistergos’ paper:
“This demonstrates that the high agreement that was previously reported is due to artefacts in the processing applied by HS93 and the exaggerated magnitude of variations they imposed. As a consequence, this also renders void arguments about the solar influence on Earth’s climate that were drawn based on the original HS93 series (e.g. Connolly et al., 2020, 2021; Scafetta, 2023; Soon et al., 2023; Georgieva and Veretenenko, 2023). Had these issues been realised earlier, the Hoyt and Schatten (1993) series would have been rather unlikely to have received the attention it did.”
And let’s face it pal, you did not criticize any paper, you just wrote your pseudoscientific alternative version of reality in your blog.
The fact that you still have not bothered to check what Chatzistergos 2024 states, but you dogmatically and religiously slander the guy and call it nonsense is all I needed to know. You are just a fake skeptic and you prove it again and again.
Oh and by the way I read the discussions with Dr. Chatzistergos you have in your blog. He f#^&ing obliterated you, which explains why you slander him so much.
“you still have not bothered to check what Chatzistergos 2024″
Which one? The original, correction #1? correction #2? correction #3? Some future correction? I’m not even sure which one I have read, does anyone know? The paper is crap.
Seeing how butthurt this paper made you made my day.
I need to buy a cake to this guy that managed to get you so butthurt twice…
Something radical ignorant Andy, read the last version.
But we all know that as a proud denier you won’t bother doing that. We both also know how butthurt you are from this.
Any chance these J K replies are just ai responses geared to annoy and frustrate readers of WUWT?  The right prompts can get some ‘interesting’ answers.  Just saying……
I am the only one showing any signs of intelligence here… All I got is cultist religious denial of reality and unwillingness  to even check the scientific sources I provided… you just show you all are fake skeptics
OK calm down J K.  Go get some aerobic exercise – run or bike or swim.  You’ll lower your blood pressure and feel less angry about everything.
J K <=> Just Kidding in txt-msg parlance.
But seriously, creating confusion seems to be what it’s all about.
Recently, I encountered a spirited defense of existing research-university practices — specifically, having a lab / research group comprised entirely of foreign grad students & postdocs — that was so compelling, I just had to look up this academese-fluent engineering professor: ‘Bill Haydon‘ …
A thorough search yielded that there was no such ‘top-university professor’ under that name.  Then, on a whim, I searched for that name in pop-culture & -history, which immediately turned up this:
Bill Haydon is a fictional character created by John le Carré who features in le Carré’s 1974 novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. He is a senior officer in the British Secret Intelligence Service who serves as a Soviet mole. The novel follows aging spymaster George Smiley‘s endeavours to uncover the mole. The character is partly modelled after the real-life double agent Kim Philby, part of the notorious Cambridge Five spy ring in Britain, who defected to the USSR in 1963.[1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Haydon
Doesn’t that give away the game?
How did you find out my real name??????
How revealing that you think asking you to think, exercise critical thinking, and read scientific papers is “geared to annoy and frustrate readers of WUWT” What an admission of what this place is… not a place for real skeptics
Then why do you waste your time here?
curiosity, how many fake skeptics does it take to find a real one on this forum. So far not even a single one skeptic found here…
No, JK is just another human climate change troll that we get here at WUWT periodically who thinks he is going to teach us something.
All we end up learning about is his psychology, and nothing new about climate change.
JK’s mission is to show his disdain for skeptics.  He doesn’t want to hear any alternatives to his favorite climate change theories.  He has convinced himself he is on the right track.
“You rebutted in your blog a paper Dr. Chatzistergos published a year later?”
The blog post is about a twitter exchange, it debates some of the same points made in Chatzistergos, 2023 and 2024, and the points you make here.
Regarding being a denier, see my paper here on the subject:
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajes.12579
So you are full of crap trying to find excuses to avoid reading an award winning scientific paper.
I am sure the fact that this paper completely obliterated WS’s and deniers’ thesis has nothing to do with your denial to even read it or your eagerness to defame the author.
I rest my case, you just proved again that you are fake, you are not a skeptic, you are just a denier.
An award winning scientific paper?
Thank you for proving that  you didn’t exercise any critical thinking to check what I posted…
https://link.springer.com/journal/11207/updates/27783240
Being a skeptic means that one must accept without questions, whatever your fake experts tell you to believe.
That’s what you fake skeptics do here, believe whatever Willie Soon, Andy May and whoever ignorant else you choose to worship without any question. Skepticism is to actually question everything, irrespectively if you like the result or not… All of you here have failed this plain test… you are no skeptics…
You are referencing papers 10 years old and some much older.
I guess since the “science is settled” this is a valid approach.
If you do not recognized sarcasm, I can recommend some papers for you to review.
2024 was 10 years or much older… hmmm I can’t argue with denier math
My wife is Ukrainian. Her parents survived the Holodomor and had neighbors and friends vanish in the Nazi death camps.
Your use of “denier” is criminally offensive.
This is an idiotic victimhood. You know that my statement is simply about all of you here denying scientific evidence, but since you also know that you have absolutely nothing to counter my arguments you decide to take this horrendous path. You should be ashamed is what you wrote is true, but since deniers lie a lot to cover their asses I doubt you are even telling the truth about this.
So, every single paper your referenced were publish in 2024 or later?
I can’t argue with cherry picking activists.
Oh your cherry picking didn’t work and now you are butthurt much?
Intellectually bankrupt is what you are. It is unbelievably hilarious seeing you all trying to think to come up with your best answers and seeing how stupid answers you get… It is not a surprise that science deniers would be so unbelievably stupid, but you did not fail to deliver
How foolish! I believe 2-4 as do many skeptics, likely most. The 20th century was not even extreme much less uniquely. Getting out of the LIA was a blessing.
I lived through 56 of the 20th Century years. So the claim it was a “uniquely extreme climatic period” makes me laugh. 🤠 Recall the saying: If you claim to remember the ’60s – you weren’t there.
{Y’all can try to make sense of this – early morning, and I’m just waking up.}
The ’60s? What’s that? 🙂
Joseph, the ’60s were the years when the doomsday clock was 1 second from midnight, so we partied like we had at least half a second left.
And man, did we   s t r e t c h  that half a second! 🙂
Wine, women, song, war, women, war, women and women.
Oh, and wine.
As the saying goes, I spent most of my money on women and whiskey… the rest I just wasted :<)
The introduction of the age of drugs, sex, and rock and roll.
FYI, mine was the last Viet Nam draft registration. I pulled number 314.
I got 356. I recall it like yesterday. About 20 of us in the dorm were listening on the radio in 1 room.
Mine was 49.  Thank Goodness for a student deferment and Richard Nixon.  I had already taken my draft physical.
Because you obviously where all over the world all the time…
Most raw temperature data from around the world show the 1930,40s a similar temperature to the 2000-2020..
Yes there was a cold period around the late 1970s, so what that it has warmed since then.
Some of that warming can be put down to rapid urban expansion and the effect of El Nino events, but there is also a large amount of “not-real” warming down to the farcical data adjustments made by the climate cult.
Prior to the satellite world, the sensors by which the climate was allegedly measured weren’t anywhere close to “all over the world” either.
Fix your sentence. It is incomprehensible as written.
Fails the “peer review.”
considering that my peers in this forum are unable to read properly, it indeed passes peer review… obviously everything posted in this forum would fail scientific peer review,.
“Because you obviously where all over the world all the time…”
Where?
How can one read properly something that is improperly written.
You are not here to discuss or debate. You are here to boost your ego through insults and attempting to start a flame war.
It is too complicated for you to remove this one h to correct the typo. If you can’t even understand what this typo is then you are a lost cause..
I am smarter than you indeed and you have proven it to me. Thanks for the ego boost. I would have been fine with a serious discussion but I see this is impossible with you sheeple.
Willie Soon’s main argument is the first one.
Do you at least accept Willie Soon is full of crap in this one?
No just that it is controversial. My view is all of the satellite record warming is residual energy from super El Niños.
https://www.cfact.org/2021/01/15/the-new-pause/
But Soon’s arguments have strength. So I am prepared to be wrong. I have known him for over 20 years and he is a great scientist.
Moving the goal post? Willie Soon’s main thesis is that global warming is primarily caused by solar activity, and he does that by relying heavily on the flawed Hoyt and Schatten 1993 TSI series.
Why would you try to move the goal post about this?…
No idea what your metaphor means, sorry. Try talking science.
How more clearly can I make it?
Willie Soon claims that global warming is primarily caused by solar activity, and he does this by relying heavily on the flawed Hoyt and Schatten 1993 MODEL, yes ALL papers by Willie Soon with the Connolly’s and Green and Grok and all others are based on a MODEL.
And not just a model, a discredited model where they manipulated the data to fake it.
Where do I get this?

Description: This paper provides a detailed critique of the Hoyt and Schatten (1993) TSI model reconstruction, highlighting its artifacts and demonstrating that updated data erases its relevance to climate change attribution, directly undermining Soon’s reliance on this model.
Still no idea what your goal posts are. You asked why I did not think the sun was the warming driver and I answered.
That you disagree with Soon is clear but that just makes it a controversy as I originally said. If you want me to adjudicate your debate with Soon I pass unless you can fund me. It would be a sizable project.
May seems to have countered your arguments above and I am sure the overall argument is large and complex, likely with several thousand separate arguments in the issue tree.
“May seems to have countered your arguments above”
I think so, too.  That JK summarily rejects May’s contributions just tells me that JK is a True Believer who has his mind made up and no amount of reason is going to change it.
So it is a waste of time to argue with him.  If Andy didn’t put doubt in his mind, then nobody will.
“Willie Soon claims that global warming is primarily caused by solar activity,”
Cloud also plays a part. The absorbed solar radiation has climbed over the last few decades.
There is no evidence of any CO2 warming in the 45 years of UAH data…
… all warming comes at El Nino events, which are charged mostly by THE SUN.
That is an incorrect.  Soon, et al say quite clearly that depending on which data is used one’s conclusion will fall on a spectrum from natural to anthropogenic.
To summarize, by varying ST and/or TSI choice and/or the attribution approach used, it is possible to conclude anything from the long-term warming being “mostly natural” to “mostly anthropogenic” or anything in between. While each of us has our own scientific opinions on which of these choices are most realistic, we are concerned by the wide range of scientifically plausible, yet mutually contradictory, conclusions that can still be drawn from the data.
You can cherry pick his statements all you want.
HEre is a recent talk by Willie Soon, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swUi106Gpao
what do you see at 40:00? The Hoyt and Schatten 1993 TSI Model!
Why does he hide that it is a model?
What does he say there? That it is the best one we have!!
Even if you paid attantion to your source you would have noticed that his claim that the Sun controls climate relies on this Hoyt and Schatten 1993 TSI model (sometimes he mentions some other equally bad and old ones).
So, what you said is wrong and I was correct all along.
I am waiting to hear from any of you any comment about Willie Soon’s reliance on a fawlty outdated and not used anymore model from 1993 as his only “evidence” the Sun controls climate. But I doubt you can comprehend the stupidity of his arguments and you will continue worshiping every crap that comes out of his mouth
OK, let’s ignore the fact that Soon did not use the Hoyt & Schatten 1993 model, he did not. But if he did what is wrong with it? Can you prove that, at least. Here are the facts:
https://andymaypetrophysicist.com/2023/07/04/a-twitter-debate-on-clintels-ipcc-ar6-critique/
Ok Let’s ignore the fact that not only you are completely ignorant about this, but you keep insisting like you are someone with credibility..
Peeps this is for you to hopefully open your eyes. Check Andy’s responses how he tries to muddy the waters and deflect from what I say by repeatedly arguing that Soon does not use the Hoyt and Schatten 1993 MODEL.
Now check Soon 2024 https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/9/179 Figure 4. What does it show? Hoyt and Schatten 1993 TSI MODEL to claim the Sun controls climate…
Green and Soon 2024 https://doi.org/10.53234/scc202501/07 page 3 3rd paragraph, what does it state? “In this study, we consider two plausible TSI reconstructions from Connolly et al. (2023). Those from Hoyt and Schatten (1993) and from Bard et al. (2000), which Connolly et al. (2023) updated to the year 20182. The former TSI record (“H1993 Solar”) was based on the so-called multiproxy—i.e., equatorial solar rotation rate, sunspot structure, the decay rate of individual sunspots, the number of sunspots without umbrae, and the length and decay rate of the 11-yr sunspot activity cycle—reconstruction of the solar irradiance history.” oh again the Hoyt and Schatten 1993 MODEL
Grok and Soon 2024…. again the Hoyt and Schatten 1993 TSI model
Connolly Soon 2021, 2023, 2024…. again the Hoyt and Schatten 1993 TSI model
Soon 2015… oh again the Hoyt and Schatten 1993 TSI model
Willie Soon has fooled you his entire career by pushing right into your face a fawlty MODEL while lying to you that it is not a model and models suck (because he had to attack climate models)
wake up peeps… they are not only lying to you, they think you are too stupid to understand it..
Oh Andy, I will take a credible scientist and his published research over some cultist ignorant person’s blog anytime. You feel butthurt because apparently this scientist obliterated your propaganda, but pal, grow a pair and deal with it. You will never have even a tiny shred of the credibility scientists have when you just do propaganda
You are not doing yourself any favors by trying to smear Andy May.
You pretend you want a scientific discussion but then you attack personally anyone who disagrees with you.
You don’t really want a discussion, you want everyone to agree with you, and you lash out when they don’t.
I think there’s psychological term for that kind of behavior.
Soon 2024 https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/9/179 Figure 4 does not show the Hoyt & Schatten 1993 model, how could it? It goes well past 2000. You keep making stuff up.
HS93 was 32 years ago, it was an outstanding paper at the time with the data available then. Connolly, Soon, et al. use an updated version that incorporates many of the ideas presented in HS93, but they clearly do not use HS93.
The paper that you rely on Chatzistergos, 2024 is a mess, corrected 3 times, we don’t even know if the final version is out yet. Give it up, you lost this one:
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-024-02262-6
Read the paper, they explain how they connected models to composites… You are ignorant and dishonest pal…
No one ever bothered to update the model before Dr Chatzistergos.
As is very cleraly stated in Chatzistergos 2024 and Soon’s papers, The only other thing they did was connect the Hoyt and Schatten 1993 model to ACRIM composite…
Do I have to spoon feed you every thing?
Corrections to papers mean… they correct things… you know… it doesn’t mean the papers are wrong…
Oh and you call it a mess, credible scientists praise it…
https://link.springer.com/journal/11207/updates/27783240
whom should we trust, the fake skeptic who knows nothing and didn’t even bother to read or understand the paper or credible scientists from that specific field…
your propaganda is unbelievable…
You are wrong. Soon acknowledges many models, as you mention and reference, and the conclusion depends on which one is used. You ignore the range of models that he looks at – cherry picking. The most conclusive statement of Soon’s view is not in a talk but in a carefully worded paper which you ignore.
WS actually looked at several of the different solar  reconstructions.
H&S is a likely to be correct as any of the others.
WS even calls it the best model out there (oh right, WS never calls it a model, because he attacks models except this one…).
It is as likely to be correct as others if you ignore the data manipulation they did, all is documented in the scientific literature pal. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-024-02262-6
The point is that the series WS needs to be correct to blame the sun are crap and discredited, which is why he has to lie to you that all of them are equally likely to be correct… You can go and measure the dimension of a building with your fingers from 1 mile away, a piece of paper from 1 mile away, and a measuring tape from the house, not all of those measurements are equally accurate. You wouldn’t come telling me that the measurement with your finger from a distance is equally likely to be correct to the measurement you took with a measuring tape while being at the house, right? Then stop falling for WS’s lies.
If you close your eyes and deny reading about them then you are just an ignorant that can’t know anything. Then why do you care to push your opinion when it is based on not reading about it?
A lot of people agree with Soon.  He has solid data on his side.
Those that claim that CO2 is the control knob have neither science nor data on their side.
The scientific sources I provided prove that WS does not have solid data on his side. Whether you agree with his machinations or not does not change that WS is full of crap
They did not “prove” it. They challenged it, true.
In what passes for your mind, the fact that you can find a propaganda site with “studies” that support what you want to believe, proves that anyone who doesn’t agree you is a science denier.
That is pretty much standard logic for an acolyte.
So you mean the sun doesn’t increase temperature? How novel. 😉
I think it is time to invoke the rule of never engaging in a battle of wits with the unarmed. He will never know when he has lost.
I am the only one that provided scientific sources to back my claims, all of them have past peer review and they have past the test of time by being scrutinized by expert scientists. Yet you only closed your eyes and ears and started shouting nonsense at y direction… Don’t let science, reality, and facts ruin your fantasy world where you are something special…thinking is not for you fake skeptics and you should be protected from thinking in any possible way.
“Global warming is primarily caused by solar activity, not human-produced greenhouse gases”
You call this a lie?
How does the Sun’s corona get so much hotter than the photosphere in the settled science world? What does it say about the “helicity barrier”
https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/
corona is how far from Earth?
And… read and weep pal. Willie Soon is full of crap.
Willie Soon’s Claim: Global warming is primarily caused by solar activity, not human-produced greenhouse gases, relying heavily on the flawed Hoyt and Schatten (1993) TSI series.
Debunking Paper: Chatzistergos, T. (2024). “A critical assessment of the Hoyt and Schatten (1993) reconstruction.” Solar Physics.

Updated data. The best kind of data to use for debunking. Debunking is especially vibrant when the abstract of your referenced debunking paper says:
“Models are used to recover total solar-irradiance (TSI) variations in the past”
This is the same model Willie Soon pushes right into your face to argue that Global warming is primarily caused by solar activity. So which one is it, are models good or bad? Because without models Willie Soon’s argument is null, void, non-existent….
So are models bad when credible scientist use them, but when Willie Soon uses them they are good?
Model output are not data. You claim they are “updated data”
So you have the problem using your terminology.
Trying to blame Willie Soon for your ignorance is disingenuous.
oh boy…
Willie Soon claim the Sun controls climate because a model of solar variations follows temperature.
The problem (for you and Willie) is that scientists have shown how bad this model is. And…. it is a model…
Read the paper and weep, though we both know that you are not interested in science, you only care about prolonging the climate propaganda.
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-024-02262-6
prove me wrong pal…
Solar TSI..  large peaks over the latter half of last century.
Willie Soon is correct.
The figure you added is one that proves Willie Soon to be wrong. It is really sad that you can’t realise that. The long-term variation is less than 0.5 W per square meter, Willie needs about 10 times more to make his point! Also notice how this series showed some increase at the beginning of 1900s, but then flattened… this is when temperature rose sharply… So if you were to think about what you posted (or even check what Willie Soon writes for this mateer..) you would have seen how this invalidates Willie Soon
“10 times more”
BS. As Judith Lean, Joanna Haigh, and many others have shown, the changes to climate from changes in solar energy are much more than the additional solar energy can account for using E = σT^4.
“However Judith Lean shows the observed surface temperature change, due to the increase in solar activity is about 0.1°C, 4 to 7 times what is expected and the increase in the upper atmosphere is 0.3°C, more than an order of magnitude more than expected from the change in radiation delivered to Earth.”
From:
https://andymaypetrophysicist.com/2024/03/03/climate-model-bias-3-solar-input/
Exactly… Willie needs to get an about 10 times greater long-term variation so that he can blame global warming on the sun…
Now if you are open minded that means its not the sun, now you being close minded ones, start by assuming the sun is driving global warming, thus it must have large variations to explain your initial assumptions…
f$%k denier logic…
What I wrote went right over your head! Zip!!
Greg Kopp series is “well respected”.
The 30year trailing average shows just how strong the solar influence has been since the mid mid 1900’s
So you think showing a solar activity flatten over the last about 60 years explains how temperature rose? Sorry, this also invalidates Willie Soon
Your link is totally debunked here.
A scientific paper totally debunked a year before it was published in a blog which doesn’t even mention that paper… Boy you are a cult… is it too hard to ask you to think…. you just prove you are no skeptics…
Quit citing Chatzistergos, T. (2024), no one takes that paper seriously and he isn’t even attacking the TSI reconstruction Soon, et al. used.
You are absolute right, no one takes that paper seriously
https://link.springer.com/journal/11207/updates/27783240
Oh wait, you meant that scientists actually praise that paper, right?
Which version of the flawed paper got the prize? The original? Correction 1, 2, or 3? Maybe a future version? The paper is crap.
You can’t even read properly, can you?
Correction 1:
“The original online article was corrected as the names of the authors Hoyt and Schatten were missing from the phrase: is the one by (J. Geophys. Res. 98, 18, 1993, HS93), present in the abstract. The phrase was now changed to: is the one by Hoyt and Schatten (J. Geophys. Res. 98, 18, 1993, HS93)”
That’s a serious correction, right? It undermines the results for you…
from correction 2:
“We also stress that since this is just a scaling of the solar cycle component, it only affects the overall amplitude of solar cycles, while it does not affect the long-term trend of the reconstructions and, thus, any of the arguments made in the originally published article (see Figure 1). However, such greater solar cycle variations lead to a slightly worse agreement between our updated TSI series with the HS93 model and Earth’s temperatures (Table 2) further strengthening our conclusions.”
oops, it made it worse for Soon…
and… there is no other correction.
Pal, you showed you know nothing about the sun, you showed that you know nothing about scientific publishing and how scientists correct mistakes they make, you also showed that you can’t read properly, and of course you showed you are dishonest
I will say something radical… when people cite the Chatzistergos 2024 paper, they refer to the current and corrected version… I know it is a radical idea that will find you against it… but what can I do, that’s how reality works pal
Sloppy work shows sloppy thinking. With or without the corrections the paper is crap. I downloaded the latest version and read it again this morning. The only thing the paper does is show that in 1993 we did not know the relationship between TSI and climate and we still do not.
It also shows that we still don’t know how TSI is varying, even with satellite data. There are too many possibilities that are very different.
Now the mystery is, how do you turn these facts into a criticism of Willie Soon? No normal person would twist facts to that extent, why do you?
oh how strange yet another post of mine disappeared… too butthurt to react to it Andy?  Shame on you peeps on WUWT silencing and cescosing anything you don’t like.
You have proven that you don’t know how scientific publishing works once again. I can show you mistakes in published papers by Willie Soon that he has not bothered to correct, does that make his papers better than those who found and corrected much more minor problems than the ones Willie Soon did? You are intellectually dishonest once again my little Andy.
ANd let me repeat that it is not me who uses this paper to obliterate Willie Soon’s work, it was Dr. Chatzistergos himself with the following text from his conclusions:
“This demonstrates that the high agreement that was previously reported is due to artefacts in the processing applied by HS93 and the exaggerated magnitude of variations they imposed. As a consequence, this also renders void arguments about the solar influence on Earth’s climate that were drawn based on the original HS93 series (e.g. Connolly et al., 2020, 2021; Scafetta, 2023; Soon et al., 2023; Georgieva and Veretenenko, 2023).
Had these issues been realised earlier, the Hoyt and Schatten (1993) series would have been rather unlikely to have received the attention it did.”
That looks bad for the lot of you rallying behind liar Willie Soon
” not human-produced greenhouse gases”
Yes, Willie is totally correct.
Your point is ??
Your reliance on a low-end, opinion-based paper from a rabid AGW cultist, that is thoroughly debunked here, is quite hilarious.
You claim that a paper was debunked one year before it was published by a person who hasn’t read the paper not even now, more than a year after it was published, and that guy, Andy May, knows nothing about the sun…
Yeahh…. no. it was not debunked, not by a longshot.
There you go, citing Chatzistergos, T. (2024)
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-024-02262-6
Which version? Original? Correction #1? Correction #2? Correction #3? Some future correction?
There are only two corrections pal…You can’t even read properly,….
Correction 1:
“The original online article was corrected as the names of the authors Hoyt and Schatten were missing from the phrase: is the one by (J. Geophys. Res. 98, 18, 1993, HS93), present in the abstract. The phrase was now changed to: is the one by Hoyt and Schatten (J. Geophys. Res. 98, 18, 1993, HS93)”
That’s a serious correction, right? It undermines the results for you…
from correction 2:
“We also stress that since this is just a scaling of the solar cycle component, it only affects the overall amplitude of solar cycles, while it does not affect the long-term trend of the reconstructions and, thus, any of the arguments made in the originally published article (see Figure 1).

oops, it made it worse for Soon…
Pal, you showed you know nothing about the sun, you showed that you know nothing about scientific publishing and how scientists correct mistakes they make, you also showed that you can’t read properly, and of course you showed you are dishonest
I will say something radical… when people cite the Chatzistergos 2024 paper, they refer to the current and corrected version… I know it is a radical idea that will find you against it… but what can I do, that’s how reality works pal
You’re looking at this subject through the lens of religion. Dr. Soon is not a heretic, he’s a scientist. It’s possible some of his hypotheses are incorrect but this is not the same as a lie.
bingo!
Every single thesis he has made is plainly wrong.
Easily demonstrable with science.
The only thing one has to do is not rely just on Willie’s lies.
can you?
Are you up for getting some science to show you how Willie Soon is full of crap?
see my comment above for some mind blowing science that completely ruins Willie Soon’s claims.
Every single point WS makes is correct. (once we remove your petty misconceptions.)
1) Global warming is primarily caused by solar activity, not human-produced greenhouse gases, (There is an urban warming component as well)
2) The 20th century was not a uniquely extreme climatic period.
3) CO2 does not significantly contribute to climate change and is not a problem.
4) Methane does not contribute to global warming.
I guess this is the gospel in the church of climate denial, where to exercise critical thinking is a mortal sin.
Pal, I gave you scientific evidence for all of his claims being wrong.
You came back with nonsense and shouting with your ears/eyes closed.
You even lmade me laugh that ignorant Andy May debunked a scientific paper one year before the paper got published and without even mentioning it…
What I got is that peeps reading this post are in a cult
Show me the test results for the nul hypothesis testing.
Without those, nothing is demonstrable.
Models are not science.
As I read through this it becomes very apparent who is “full of crap.”
“4 of his main lies:
 #4 Methane does not contribute to global warming,”
__________________________________________
Yes methane is a greenhouse gas and should contribute to global 
warming.  The question is how much?  The usual metric is so much 
warming by 2100.  If you can demonstrate that by the end of the
century the warming caused by methane is on track be significantly 
more than an Immeasurable1/20th of a degree, you should pipe up 
and show your source and work.
Your side of the coin consistently commits a lie of omission by never 
saying how little methane’s effect will be.
Your response will be greatly appreciated.

You at least accept greenhouse effect. Good.
Willie Soon’s Claim: Methane does not contribute to global warming, citing Titan’s cold climate.
Debunking Paper: Etminan, M., et al. (2016). “Radiative forcing of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide: A significant revision of the methane radiative forcing.” Geophysical Research Letters, 43(24), 12614–12623.
Methane can only be significant when water vapor is very low, such as in deserts or in poles in winter, otherwise water vapor will already have absorbed its frequencies. How these idiotic papers pass peer-review is beyond my understanding.
Let’s agree on this, scientific papers are beyond your understanding
I noticed the attached in your Etminan paper:
It seems that methane in a region of strong water vapor absorption leads to negative forcing. This is, of course, true. It also happens in cloudy areas. Methane has a very small effect in the real world. Too small a concentration and it is ineffective.
You didn’t answer the question, “How much warming will methane cause by 2100?”
Your answer just repeated something about the Global Warming Potential [Numbers] which says nothing about actual change in global warming.
So business as usual, since methane is increasing by about ~7 ppb annually, how much global warming will that cause by 2100?
Check IPCC pal. it can be anything between 0.2 and 0.6 degrees. but it really depends on our emmissions path, so that’s the tricky part. The observed warming since 1850 due to methane is already about 0.5 degrees.
But I don’t understand what you want to argue here, that this is too small, or that you would like this small warming?
“The observed warming since 1850 due to methane”
That made me laugh.
Who observed this warming?  How was that accomplished?
The observed warming since 1850 due to methane is already about 0.5 degrees.
So it is about 1/3rd to 1/4th of the entire warming the globe has experienced.  Lotsa luck with showing that.
Is the temperature in 1850 the optimum temperature for the globe?  If so, tell us how you determined that.  Would you entertain that 16°C would be the optimum temperature?  If so, the ΔT’s you are discussing are only approaching the best temperature and we still have a way to go.
How was methane’s warming measured in 1850 in the atmosphere?
Greenland and Antarctic ice core measurements. You can’t be that ignorant, can you?
Greenland and Antarctic ice core measurements.
The ice cores provides detailed measurements of temperature and what the attribution of each element is?  LOL!
Those are not measurements made in 1850.
Those are proxies with error bands and several factors that make them only proxies.
“The 20th century was not a uniquely extreme climatic period.”
So, the 20th century was the most extreme climate period in Earth’s history? Or even the last several thousand years?
See how Willie Soon is vague in this statement, and how you pick on it to mislead.
The Earth has been much warmer, as credible scientists show us, but Soon’s claim is that “20th century was not a uniquely extreme climatic period”, which is easily shown to be a wrong claim by Willie, without needing it to be the warmest period. simple text comprehension pals..
20th century was “tepid” at best.  Absolutely nothing “extreme about it.
Far cooler than most of the last 10,000 years,
… barely a degree or so of highly beneficial warming above the LIA, coldest period in those 10,000 year
keep repeating this to yourself, at some point you will believe it and your eyes will stop seeing the data
Also note that the start year was one of the coldest in the 19th century.
Also note that CO2 measurements made by scientists of that era were in the early 1800s comparable to today.
The problem with those 1800s measurements, of course, is no means to verify and limited instrumentation and measurements made and different measurement technology.
What empirical evidence do you have that supports your position about Soon’s “4 main lies”?

All debunked and thrown out of the window.
Repeating the same debunked stuff a second time?
Everyone knows you have to do it three times (while clicking your heels together).:-)
Like most acolytes, he will repeat his rehearsed lies until everyone else gives up on repeatedly refuting him.  At which point he declares victory and goes home.
I provide the links again hoping that at least one of you is a real skeptic and will exercise critical thinking and read them. What can I say, I am an optimist, but you are making it too difficult for me to remain optimist that there is even one real skeptic in this forum. So far you prove yourselves to be members of a cult of ignorance who denies reading anything that might question the scripture and beliefs of your cult. prove me wrong pal.
I perused a couple the papers you reference.  They all concentrate on the value and sign of ΔT.
Neither mentioned what they considered the optimum global average temperature should be nor how the “unprecedented ΔT” warming is moving toward the optimum temperature or moving away from the optimum temperature.
I am sorry for you that you are unable to understand what scientific papers write.
We have a cult!?!?
Cool.
And no membership dues, nor do we have to pay to be published.
Most cults ask their members to commit suicide at some point. Prove me wrong, but your cult does the same, but in a long way which will take us all with you. Wake up sheeple… think and exercise critical thinking…. some of you might still be able to think…
What you fail to recognize is we are thinking critically and your claim to the contrary is based only on our refusing to submit to a rabid appeal to authority.
You do not know me. But you attribute characteristics to me based on your personal bias. That you insult and repeatedly post the same nonsense is sufficient to create a valid perception that you have no critical thinking skills.
Not even a single person in this forum started a discussion about what I posted, you all started shouting nonsense, mostly irrelevant to what I posted, just to deflect.
I know you don’t like thinking, but why are you lying to yourselves when you clearly didn’t even bother checking what I posted?… that is fake skepticism pal… I need to force feed  you things from my first post just because what you come to tell me are irrelevant or stupid and you could have gotten your answers to the link I shared… but none of you clearly bothered to check them because you are not interested in reading anything that can ruin your religious beliefs about climate…
That’s not empirical evidence debunking Soon’s argument that the data can be used to produce a range of conclusions.
The request was for “empirical” evidence. Not studies and reports.
The request was for what evidence “you” have.
This is just a deflection and an appeal to authority.

“This demonstrates that the high agreement that was previously reported is due to artefacts in the processing applied by HS93 and the exaggerated magnitude of variations they imposed. As a consequence, this also renders void arguments about the solar influence on Earth’s climate that were drawn based on the original HS93 series (e.g. Connolly et al., 2020, 2021; Scafetta, 2023; Soon et al., 2023; Georgieva and Veretenenko, 2023).”
That completely obliterated WS and his ilk.
Who are we kidding though, you obviously won’t bother to read it because you are not a skeptic either… prove me wrong pal…
That is not your evidence.
You are using someone else’s.
Your evidence is to post a link to someone else’s research.
I do not owe you anything nor do I have to perform for you.
Keep throwing the mud.
Your opinion does not matter.
That is plainly laughable. I am posting published science after peer review which also past the test of time being scrutinized by expert scientists and they completely obliterated the lies of Willie Soon and you are telling me this is not good enough, I need to present you my work without peer review or any scrutiny from actual scientists?…. Is this how you treat science in this forum? Like kids playing doctor, having no idea what theya re saying?…. You really are jokes…
Well the way Willie Soon presents the obvious is amusing and makes me laugh, reading through your comments…ehm, I think the parody are you.
I believe “big brother” let’s you post here so we all have something to laugh at..the downvotes are just to please you.
Ok so you care about entertainment rather than truth. fair enough.
Wouldn’t it be better just watching some stand up comedian then, or treating Willie Soon as a stand up comedian, that arguably he is?
Leave the science to people who don’t lie for a comedic effect
No. It is not about caring about entertainment.
You have not presented the “truth” as the truth is not known. More of a shadow on the cave wall.
What we are enjoying is your comic relief. A good laugh.
Thanks for the comedic effect.
What we are seeing here is a tragic inability of people claiming to be skeptics to exercise any shred of critical thinking.
can you read the following statements from this paper?
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-024-02262-6

That completely obliterated WS and his ilk.
It exposes that all WS has done is use a model where the authors manipulated the data to make it match Earth’s temperature! This is a fact and demonstrated in scientific papers. But you another fake skeptic closes your eyes to it and keeps worshipping your propaganda gurus like WS and Andy May…
Who are we kidding though, you obviously won’t bother to read even what I wrote here because you are not a skeptic either… prove me wrong pal… I have asked 100 times for supposed skeptics to prove me wrong and show their skepticism… so far you all failed…
Gotta love it when the defeated claims victory.
Indeed, because you are too stupid to realise how the above segment and the analysis in that paper has completely obliterated the whole thesis of Willie Soon, but you still claim victory…
And every one of his 4 points is correct.
Your point is !??
There is no evidence of CO2 caused warming in the UAH data, …
… and there is zero possibility of reliable finding any CO2 warming in the surface data because it is too corrupted by urban warming, farcical sites, and data manipulation.
If we go back through history, the first science reports under the then UN Environmental Program / first IPCC summary report determined there was no human signature in the data. An official from the Clinton/Gore administration went over and rewrote it declaring a definite human signature. The scientists and researchers were livid. A rule was put in place that if the science reports disagreed with the (political) summary, it was the science reports that were to be changed.
The original charter was to study the climate both natural and anthropogenic. After the rewrite the charter was changed to determine the effects of CO2 on the climate.
In other words, from the beginning, this became a conclusion that needed a matching model.
Dr Soon is by far one of the most honest climate scientists alive. Who do you think you are challenging his integrity? Few people have the integrity to fight the machine, and Dr Soon is one of them. He made huge personal sacrifices to fight for the truth.
I challenge you to refute any of the claims in this video. If you want to see a scientist with 0.00 integrity, look at Michael Mann and this video proves it.

you ask me to do what I already did and you ignored… that’s funny.
Pal if you want to live in yout fantasy world where Willie Soon is credible, so be it.
But I have already provided credible scientific sources that dismantle Willie Soon’s propaganda. If at any point you want to wake up and smell the coffee… go read them, but don’t act like you are a skeptic, you are just a cultist
Not credible.
This is credible whether you like it or not

Had these issues been realised earlier, the Hoyt and Schatten (1993) series would have been rather unlikely to have received the attention it did. “
Not credible.
It is not a matter of belief.
You have no clue what I know.
I know that you treat science as religion. You define as credible only what you like.
Pal, science doesn’t care about your feelings or your dogma.
The paper I posted above IS credible, has even won awards, the fact that it obliterated Willie Soon’s thesis should make you think and reevaluate how much you beieve Willie Soon’s lies, but deniers don’t have this mental capability, so you have to distort and deny everything else except from Willie Soon’s lies…
Read and weep… (but who are we kidding, deniers don’t like reading or thinking)

Since all 4 of your points are provably correct, what’s your big problem?
My point is that it is dishonest to state that someone stood for scientific integrity when he has spent decades deliberately fooling you.
Ah, the IPCC model? Got it.
And yes, we have it ladies and gentlemen, you can’t even read.
And you cannot have a mature conversation. When someone fails to applaud your nonsense, you are primed to throw insults.
If you had a little brain you would see how quickly the deniers jumped in to obfuscate. You are not here for a reasonable discussion, you either want endless agreement in whatever nonsense you post or you love to just insult people, like me, who have the audacity to think and read before talking…
Coincidentally, money is green.
That’s right. Even when they come from black oil industry, as Willie Soon has taken, the money is still green.
When it comes to receipts, Willie doesn’t hold a candle to the grifters who live off and get disgustingly rich from taxpayer-funded “climate research” and promotion.
And you know that.
Be honest.
I know, and he got money from oil industry and he has managed to convince you to be against scientific funding. Governmental funding does not affect the outcomes of the results, this can’t be said about fossil fuel payments…
When you complain about standard scientific funding, then you are attacking free speech and scientific discussion. You have been fooled by Willie Soon to attack science..
Just so we can place “he got money from oil industry” in rational, comparative perspective, what untold riches are we talking about here?
(nearest hundred US dollars will be sufficient, no need for 3 decimal places of a dollar)
The talking points memo JK is working from never got that detailed.
He makes a decent living all these decades that he is not in a university. He must have some income, right? well..
Just like with CO2, you are assuming too much.
So you can’t tell us how much money Soon got from oil companies, can you?  But you are sure he got some.  No links or anything?
My understanding is Soon got NO money from oil companies.  The university Soon worked at got some oil money, but that doesn’t mean Soon got any, or that any oil money influenced his research.
Claiming Soon is in the pay of oil companies has been a Climate Alarmist conspiracy theory for years.
Climate Alarmists must destroy anyone who deviates from the CO2 control knob theory, so they attack Soon and anyone else who does not stay on their message.
That’s what you are doing now.
Willie Soon is still an Astrophysicist with the Solar and Stellar Physics (SSP) Division of the Center for Astrophysics Harvard and Smithsonian, although he does do other work, speaking engagements, etc. He is associated with the Center for Environmental Research (CERES) and Earth Sciences and Institute of Earth Physics and Space Science, Sopron, Hungary.
Willie Soon hasn’t been at Harvard in ages, why are you lying about this? He was misusing an old affiliation to claim credibility… but he is not there anymore… But facts don’t matter for you, I know
The whole story about “he got money from oil industry” is in my book in detail with documentation.
“I know, and he got money from oil industry ““
That is basically A LIE.
The Smithonian gets money form a huge variety of sources, including a LOT from renewable propaganda interests and far-left billionaires.
Willie received fund from the Smithonian with zero ties attached.
Might as well say he got funding from the “climate ” trough.
Any funding he got is totally dwarfed by “renewables” funding to alarmist pseudo-scientists.
Translation, when my guys accept money from others, they are as pure as the driven snow.
Everyone else, unless they are completely self supporting are hopelessly corrupted.
JK, have you ever bothered trying to think for yourself.
Two important points:
I would note that it has been proven, by the U.S. Congress that the Sea Change Foundation is funded by Russia. They launder Russian money so they can fight against shale gas development.

I should add that the whole reprehensible New York Times attack on Soon in 2015 is discussed in detail in my book on pages 73-86. The lies were made up by Greenpeace operative Kert Davies, a true slimeball, and fed to Justin Gillis and John Schwartz at the New York Times who didn’t even bother to check the facts.
Is there any lie so disproven that you won’t eagerly repeat it.
Soon did some work for Heritage.
Heritage had a grant from an oil company for a project that had nothing to do with climate change, and Soon did not work on that grant.
Only someone so desperate to push his religion on others would keep with your lies.
I had a Uni Professor friend, a realist, who the climate cult tried to smear as getting funds from a coal company.
Yes, but the funds were for a PhD student who was looking at the effects of run-off from coal and ash heaps in the local rivers and creeks, and the student’s work actually helped clean up some issues.
They were “environmental” funds.
There was a faith and they all believed in it. They cling to it still; thou heretic…
“activism” has been crafted in every profession, from schoolteacher to journalist, to civil servant. Naturally, being unscientifically minded they go with a convenient and plausible [political] consensus – they believe it, they’re wiser than I am, ergo it must be true. And it is based upon ideas/theories etc that have been falsified no end of times. That’s why modelling has become the last refuge of the scoundrel.
That’s where heresy comes in and people get cancelled.
Climate Change is politics.
“Climate Change” is the latest psycho linguistic descriptive meme used to simplify language into a call for action. Climate change is nothing other than weather change for 30 years, which happens all day every day anyway.
Such a shame that rain can ruin your parade, isn’t it? When was the last time you saw people protesting rain?
Among those slandered, let’s also remember Frederick Seitz, Fred Singer, and Patrick Michaels.
In 1996 Fred Seitz called attention to Ben Santer’s fabrication of the ‘discernible human influence’ falsehood in the IPCC 2AR. For that call for scientific integrity, the smear machine turned full force on him.
The mavens of smear were also merciless toward Pat Michaels and Fred Singer, whose only fault was to adhere to the truth.
Good additions, thanks.
Congratulations to Andy on writing such a book, and of a quality to garner praise from Patrice.
Politics and Climate Change looks like a book I should have, and will have. Thanks, Andy, for making so worthwhile an effort.
Thanks Pat.
Not to be nebby, any idea when updated edition will be available in print?
I have no plans to update the book at this time, but I think you will find the original very informative.
Thanks, I have the original, well, had. It currently is with a friend of mines kids, they were using it at school, little conservative trouble makers.
Glad to hear it!
I would like somehow to get the link to that UN official in the mid-1970s who was talking about the impending mini ice age who said words to the effect that we do not know if CO2 is the cause but it is something that can be quantified and taxed.
Andy, this videos have all the science, data and concepts you need to debunk the CO2 drives Climate Change. It is a 100% Hoax and these videos will prove it using real science.

And again you deleted my last responses.
Why are you so afraid that you have to censor people who think and do their own research and back everything they say with published science?
Is this your admittance of being in a cult of ignorance?
You disgrace the name skeptics, you are no skeptics
J K,
Your last several comments were “pending approval” probably due to language. They are vacuous, but I approved them. They do not make you look very good.
All my messages need approval, which I am sure the others don’t and that is even when I don’t say anything “weird” see this one for example… And think of all those that you people silently did not approve…I hope others start to realise what you do here
JK – I have had comments pending in the past, so your certainty that it is only you is seriously misplaced.  Might want to get that chip off your shoulder.
various comments of mine are gone
Yup, stupid shit, name calling, to the trash bin.
You deleted posts of mine that don’t have any of this. And ALL of my posts require approval, which I am sure is not the case for others here…
This is discrimination so that you can silence and censor anything you don’t like.. You should be ashamed
Arguing about the minutia of ΔT’s measurement uncertainty has become rather boring.  Thinking last night about the problem it dawned on me that worrying about the sign of ΔT gets one nowhere.
Warmists like to show by trending that ΔT has been constantly increasing in conjunction with increasing CO2.  So what?  The real question is what is, what temperature is it warming from and what temperature is it warming to.
It points out the necessity of knowing three things:
This requires one to begin analyzing the absolute global average temperature in terms of a holistic assessment of what we are discussing.  For example, is the optimum absolute global average temperature what it was in 1800?  If so, then a consistent +ΔT since 1800  is obviously not a good thing.  On the other hand is the optimum absolute global average temperature 16°C, 17°C, 20°C?  If so, then a +ΔT is a good thing.
If anyone has ever been involved in drag racing, one discovers very quickly that ΔT is not the sole determining variable one must shoot for.  I may put a very high ratio rear end in my car and reach 60 mph in 2 seconds, a very high ΔT, but if I am stuck at 60 mph for the rest of the 1/4 mile, I’m not going to win much.  The real goal is elapsed time over the entire 1/4 mile strip, not maximum ΔT for a very short period of time.
Similarly, ΔT in climate should not be the issue.  The holistic absolute global average temperature should be the goal.  Determining this is not something climate scientists can do alone.  It requires a multi-discipline focus on many aspects of the life on this planet.
Rather than dwelling solely on how ΔT is calculated and its sign, my suggestion is to ask the warmists what their prediction for an optimum temperature should be and where do we stand in relation to that temperature.
I don’t know what the optimum temperature is either. The first primates that we are descended from probably evolved during the PETM about 56 million years ago, when the global average surface temperature was around 26 deg, or about 11 deg warmer than today. They did very well and spread around the globe very quickly. I suppose that works as an ideal temperature. Another possibility is the average global surface temperature for the Phanerozoic, which is 5 deg warmer than today.
Either way, today is too cold.
More on the PETM when our distant ancestors evolved:

Andy,
Thanks for the information.  I came across an article this morning about white bark pines being uncovered in Wyoming.  They appear to be 5000 yrs old.  That means current temps are close to those at 5000 yrs. ago.
It is time for climate science to concentrate on what an optimum temperature actually is.  Without knowing that ΔT means nothing.
I agree.
what is the optimum global average absolute temperature
Every time I have asked this question it has been met with silence.
I find it interesting that over the mid-1800s to present interval, atmospheric CO2 is estimated to have increased ~50% ppm while temperature over the same interval has increased ~0.5% K.
0.5% versus 50%.
