At Bored Panda, I enjoy exploring the fascinating worlds of technology and home improvement, two areas that I love diving into. When I'm not immersed in my work, you'll often find me indulging in my hobbies: gaming and analog photography. I've built quite a charming collection of old cameras, each with its own story and charm. Whether I’m exploring the latest tech trends or capturing memories on vintage film, I enjoy bringing creativity and passion to everything I do.
