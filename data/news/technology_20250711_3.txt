Prime Day never fails to bring a highlight for fitness fanatics and Amazon puts the spotlight on all things from fitness trackers and Garmin sport watches to sound gear for high-energy lifestyles. Among the biggest buzz-worthy launches this year is the SHOKZ OpenRun Pro 2, a headset designed specifically for sportsmen and fitness fans. If you’re a Prime member, you can get these headphones at an all-new all-time low price on Amazon.
The SHOKZ OpenRun Pro 2 is available for $124, down from its regular price of $179. This 31% off deal is the best that this model has ever gone for, and it’s one that’s driving the fitness community wild. With over 6,000 units sold in the past month and a 4.5-star rating from thousands of reviews, it’s clear these headphones are a hit among gym-goers and runners alike. This offer is part of Amazon’s Prime Day deals, so you’ll need a Prime membership to take advantage of this record-low price.

What sets the SHOKZ OpenRun Pro 2 apart is its open-ear bone conduction technology which delivers sound through your cheekbones instead of over the ears. This allows your ears to stay open to the world around you which is a valuable feature for anyone who likes to stay attuned while running on the road or working out in an overcrowded gym. The dual drivers combine bone conduction and air conduction to provide clean highs and low bass for an engaging sound experience.
The headset sports a lightweight and ergonomic frame and memory wire ear hooks that give a stable fit that won’t shift or slip under vigorous activity. The open-ear design also reduces the discomfort and ear fatigue of in-ear or over-ear headphones even during long training sessions. SHOKZ has added a reflective strip for extra safety while running at night, so the headset is an intelligent option for runners who run early in the morning or at night.
What’s more, OpenRun Pro 2 gives you up to 12 hours of continuous playtime per charge so you can exercise for hours or play all day without worrying about running out of battery. Fast charging support means you can play for hours from a quick charge.
The SHOKZ OpenRun Pro 2 is also easy to use and personalize: Dedicated EQ modes, accessible through the Shokz app, enable you to personalize your music based on where you are. Switch to Classic Mode for pure bone conduction sound or use Volume Boost Mode to enhance your tunes in noisy places. The headset is obviously also sweat-resistant so it’s great for intense workouts.
Call quality is exceptional due to dual wind-resistant microphones and AI noise reduction technology which eliminate up to 96.5% of background noise—even wind at 15 miles per hour. It’s simple to answer calls on the go, whether running outside or in a crowded gym.
If you’re looking for a good audio solution for your workouts, the SHOKZ OpenRun Pro 2 at $124 is a deal that’s hard to beat.
