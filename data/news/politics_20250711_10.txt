Tim Myers, a former member of OneRepublic, is running to be the lieutenant governor of California after Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis announced her bid to succeed incumbent governor Gavin Newsom.
Stop and stare—because OneRepublic alum Tim Myers is getting into politics.
The 40-year-old, who served as a bassist for Ryan Tedder-fronted rock band from 2002 to 2007, announced his bid for lieutenant governor of California.
The state's current lieutenant governor Eleni Kounalakis is running to succeed incumbent governor Gavin Newsom, who cannot run for re-election due to term limits.
"I’m not a politician. I’m a dad, a husband, a businessman, an activist, and the son of a pastor who taught me that faith without action is meaningless," Myers wrote on his campaign website. "We can’t keep doing the same old thing.  It hasn’t worked."
The musician continued, "It’s time for a different approach and I’m the only candidate in this race who will bring the change we need."
Earlier this year, Myers announced his intention to run against Rep. Ken Calvert for the California's 41st congressional district. That campaign website has since been deactivated.
Of course, Myers is not the first celebrity to run for political office in the Golden State. Before he became president, Ronald Reagan left his acting career behind to become the governor of California. He held the post from 1967 to 1975.
Decades later, Arnold Schwarzenegger ran—and won—the 2003 recall election to replace then-governor Gray Davis. The Terminator star continued his run as "Governator" when he elected for a second term in 2006, and exited office in 2011 after reaching the maximum number of terms a governor can serve.
Caitlyn Jenner also tried her hand at becoming California's governor in 2021. However, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum earned just 1 percent of the vote in a special election to recall Newsom, allowing the politician to keep his position.
So, does this mean Newsom—who has publicly traded barbs with President Donald Trump—is considering to run for the highest office in the United States?
"I’m not thinking about running," he told the Wall Street Journal in June, "but it’s a path that I could see unfold."
