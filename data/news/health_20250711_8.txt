In the northern hemisphere, it's hard not to spend the winter in a state of slumbering sloth, just waiting for sunshine and good times to start again. Conveniently, Prime Day fitness tracker deals (all four days of them) drop right in the middle of summer, which makes this a great time to pick up the smartwatch or smart ring that you just didn't have the cash for at Christmas.
This year, you have four whole days to shop the Amazon deals, but if you don't want to take that much time, I've highlighted the sales on some of our favorite fitness trackers and smart rings. Not a subscriber yet? Perhaps our list of the best Amazon Prime Perks can convince you to sign up. Deal hunters should also check out our Best Amazon Prime Day Deals roundup and Prime Day liveblog.
Updated July 10, 2025: We've added new deals on the Fitbit Inspire 3, Samsung Galaxy Watch7, and the Polar H10.
Oura

Oura
As you might expect with my job, I am frequently asked what fitness tracker to get, and this year, more often than not, I have told people to just buy an Oura Ring 4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) . You don't have to wear it on your wrist, the battery life is longer than most trackers, and Oura issues interesting, meaningful software updates regularly. This is the first time it's gone on sale, and you should get it.

Hello Lingo
Of all the fitness trackers that I've tested this year, none has inspired as many questions as a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). You click the sensor on your arm and a tiny sensor reads the glucose in your interstitial fluid. When you eat something that spikes your blood sugar, like, oh, a cookie, you get an alert on your phone saying, “No! Don't do that!” If you're pre-diabetic or dealing with a health condition, you're probably very interested in getting one. Abbott is currently offering 9-15 percent off the sensors.

Fitbit has faced pretty stiff competition over the years (most notably from the Apple Watch), but its flagship Charge line is still the best overall fitness tracker for the money. Even tracking multiple activities a day, the battery lasts over a week. The updated app looks great, and multiple Google integrations make the Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) easier to use than ever.
Apple

The Apple Watch Series 10 is the best fitness tracker for iPhone users. It still doesn't have blood oxygen sensing due to a patent dispute, but it's otherwise a solid fitness tracker. The standout feature is sleep apnea notifications. The watch uses an accelerometer and machine learning to check if you have breathing disturbances at night. The Series 10 is also thinner, lighter, easier to wear, and charges faster than previous models.

Withings
Before I even started this job, I had purchased the original Withings Steel HR, which was the first of Withings' gorgeous fitness trackers that don't even look like regular fitness trackers. The Scanwatch 2 follows in that tradition with a comprehensive suite of health features and Withings' new cardiac-focused health features, like Cardio Check-Up, which lets you send your cardiac data instantly to Withings' board of certified cardiologists.
Fitbit

I have personally convinced many parents in my life to buy the Fitbit Ace LTE (7/10, WIRED Recommends) for their kids. It's a Fitbit, so it works even if one parent is Android and the other is Apple (if so, why?), and the $10/month subscription includes data, so you don't need to fuss with adding service to your cell plan. Fitbit Arcade incentivizes my kids to keep their watches on and charged, and I like Google's included kids' safety features.
Samsung

Samsung
The Samsung Galaxy Ring (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is slim and lightweight, with decent sleep tracking, the ability to auto-detect workouts, and accurate cycle and heart rate tracking. You need a Samsung watch or phone to take full advantage, but Samsung's devices are slick when used together.
Garmin

Garmin

Garmin is known for its Forerunner series of running watches. The Forerunner 255 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the older version of the Forerunner 265 that we recommend in our roundup, but Garmins age well, and the older version does have some features to recommend it over the newer one, like better battery life.
Amazfit
Amazon
Amazfit
It may be cheap, but the Amazfit Active 2 (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) is no slouch on the sensor front with a photo plethysmography (PPG) sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometric altimeter, ambient light, and temperature sensor to track your sleep, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation. It also boasts tons of workout modes, long battery life, and 5 ATM water resistance.
Apple

While it's not the most exciting Apple watch, the SE series is the cheapest way to try out an Apple fitness tracker. The SE uses watchOS 11, which can connect to the Vitals app, which makes it easy to check your heart rate and respiration in a dashboard without hunting through the Health or Fitness apps. It has the last S8 chip, which is what the Series 8 has, and features like Crash Detection to call your emergency contact and emergency responders if you've been in a car accident. The SE series doesn't have the latest health features, like the ability to check your skin temperature, and the display is noticeably smaller than Apple's other options, but for the price this is hard to beat, especially on sale.
Samsung

Samsung’s flagship smartwatch is a no-brainer for folks in Samsung’s ecosystem. The Galaxy Watch Ultra boasts dual-band GPS, excellent health and activity monitoring features, and two-day battery life. It's tough, too, with a titanium case and 10 ATM/IP68 ratings. Samsung announced a newer version of the Galaxy Watch Ultra, but it's actually the same watch with 64 GB of storage and a new color, so it's smart to snag this one for half its MSRP.
Ultrahuman

Ultrahuman
While the Oura Ring 4 is undoubtedly the champion of smart rings, you'll be paying $8 a month if you want the full experience. The Ultrahuman Ring Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends), though, comes with an included “lifetime subscription,” meaning you'll have full access to your data and analytics when you pick one of these up. It's the first time the price has dropped this low too, so if ever there was a time, it's now.

Here's proof that reliable tracking doesn't have to be expensive. The standout feature of the Fitbit Inspire 3 is its incredibly long battery life. We're talking up to 10 days! The teeny, tiny AMOLED screen is super bright, making it easy to see your stats despite its tiny size.
Garmin

Most Garmin watches aren't likely to win any beauty prizes—they're chunky, with an emphasis on the technical over aesthetic. The Lily 2 is the exception. It's Garmin that looks more like, well, a nice watch. You can even get it with a leather band. It's one of the smallest Garmins and battery life is on the short side—three to four days. But it has a Pulse Ox sensor, a beautiful Corning Gorilla Glass lens, a metal bezel, and standard Garmin features like Body Battery and fall detection.

Slick looks, Fitbit integration, and bags of features, the Google Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best Wear OS watch for folks with an Android phone. It's no slouch as a health and fitness tracker, with electrocardiogram readings, sleep tracking, heart rate readings, blood-oxygen measurements, and stress tracking.
Samsung
Amazon
Samsung
Samsung phone owners should consider this wearable as it offers excellent health and fitness tracking and some exclusive features that only work when paired with a Samsung phone, such as FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. It's a great discount but that's partly because the new one has just arrived.

Amazon
Target
It might be a little long in the tooth, but the Fitbit Sense 2 is probably still the best for serious health tracking and the closest to a competitor for the Apple Watch. It has ECG functionality, and can track your stress. There's also built-in GPS, an SpO2 sensor, and a skin temperature sensor, too.
Polar
Amazon
Polar
While fitness trackers generally have built-in heart rate monitors, a separate strap on your bicep or around your chest is far more accurate when things get sweaty and intense during a tough workout. Polar's strap has a comfortable buckle connector and silicone dots to keep it in place.

If you still have a humble bathroom scale, it may be time to upgrade to one that has fancy new tricks, like tracking your vascular age and visceral fat. The Withings Body Comp connects directly to the Withings app (so you don't need to have your phone nearby) and shows a staggering amount of data, everything from your weight to muscle mass, heart rate, pulse wave velocity, and weird things like the air quality and your body water percentage.
