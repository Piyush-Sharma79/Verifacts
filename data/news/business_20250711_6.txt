Ever wonder how the most successful business leaders get it all done? Business Insider's "Power Hours" series explores that question by diving into the daily routines of top executives, founders, and creatives across industries — from aerospace and transportation to venture capital and the creator economy.
We've profiled leaders like Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's CEO, who starts his day before dawn and avoids unnecessary meetings, and David Risher, the CEO of Lyft, who winds down with matcha in the afternoons and takes undercover driving shifts to inform his work.
Each story offers an inside look at how these high performers meticulously structure their waking hours to achieve their personal and professional goals. Besides giving us a window into their workdays, the leaders featured discuss exercise, rest, and tips on staying sharp, protecting energy, boosting productivity, and more.
