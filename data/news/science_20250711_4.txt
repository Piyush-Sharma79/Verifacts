Right now, Amazon‚Äôs annual Prime Day shopping holiday is in full swing. There are lots of great deals to be found, but this Meta Quest 3S bargain is one you shouldn‚Äôt miss. At $249, this is the cheapest the Quest 3S has ever been, which makes this a great time to dive into mixed reality or upgrade your headset if you‚Äôre using an older model. This deal will likely sell out or end before the Prime Day promotion ends July 11, so grab one now if you‚Äôre thinking about it. Remember, if you don‚Äôt have an active Prime subscription, you can sign up for a free 30-day¬†trial here.
Meta‚Äôs mixed reality headset has a camera array on the outside of the device, so it can integrate digital on-screen images with the real world. Want to sit at your desk and have a gigantic monitor in front of you? You can do it. You can also virtually sit courtside at basketball games or fully immerse yourself into awesome games like Beat Saber.
This kit includes the headset as well as a pair of advanced controllers. The 3S offers twice the graphics performance as the Quest 2 that came before it, and it‚Äôs comfortable even for long sessions. I recently tried it for productivity for the first time, and I was impressed with how useful it actually is. Having the freedom to put my computer screens in any size and orientation in VR has made my regular desk feel extremely boring.
While you‚Äôre at it, maybe buy one for your pet mouse, too.
