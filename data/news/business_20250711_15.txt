As the AI talent wars rage on, Google and other tech giants are shelling out top dollar to lure top talent.
Google has long been revered within Silicon Valley for its generous compensation packages, and its DeepMind unit even resorted to aggressive noncompetes in the UK.
At the same time, Google has made changes to its compensation processes in recent months as others in the tech industry — such as Meta and Microsoft — have sought to weed out low performers.
In April, the search giant changed the way it ranked employees in their yearly performance reviews. Its head of compensation told staff in a memo that "high performance is more important than ever," Business Insider previously reported.
While Google keeps salary data confidential, publicly available work-visa data can provide a glimpse into how much it pays for certain roles. The figures are derived from filings that all companies submit to the Labor Department to obtain work visas for foreign workers.
Google employs thousands of software engineers through this process, and according to the data, they can command salaries as high as $340,000.
It's worth noting that these figures reflect only salaries and don't account for the equity or bonuses that Google employees also receive.
In 2023, BI obtained an internal spreadsheet where thousands of Googlers self-reported their 2022 pay, including some equity and bonus data. Despite the relatively high sums, many said they still felt underpaid.
Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
