It’s no secret that science has accelerated the progress of humanity. Without the curious minds that seek to explore our surroundings, we wouldn’t have the breakthroughs and discoveries that created the world we live in today. But while our fascination with biology, physics, chemistry, and other captivating fields shows no signs of fading, not every practice is worth celebrating.

So let us introduce you to a Facebook group called 'The Darker Side Of Science.' This online community is all about discussing the lesser-known methods that may not sit so well today, and sharing some science-related laughs along the way. "Bad experiments, worse scientists, studies you wish to god you could unsee, and much, much more," the admins write in the description, providing space for the interestingly weird and equally hilarious.
Our science-loving team has gone through their feed and collected some of the geekiest memes and jokes to share with you all.
