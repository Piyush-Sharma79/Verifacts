Amazon Prime Day is arguably the best time of the year to upgrade your pet's setup for way less dough. As the pet tech writer here at WIRED, I have strong opinions about which (often pricey) pet gear is worth the money. From automatic litter boxes to feeders and fountains, and even DNA testing kits and pet cameras, I've pulled together the best Prime Day pet deals on WIRED-tested gear for this event, which runs through July 11. I'll be updating with more deals as I find them, so make sure you're checking back often.
You'll find a wider selection of bargains in our Absolute Best Prime Day Deals roundup and Prime Day liveblog.
Updated 5 pm ET July 11, 2025: We've added Temptations cat treats, a new dog bed, and an interactive cat toy, and ensured updated links and prices.

Petlibro
The Polar Wet Food Feeder is the upgraded version of Petlibro's wet automatic feeder and is the best on the market right now. This automatic feeder is specifically designed to store and schedule wet-food meals using what's essentially a mini-fridge. The refrigeration uses thermoelectric cooling and stays at 50 degrees Fahrenheit or below, and cooling is paused 30 minutes before the scheduled feeding time to make sure the food is at the ideal temperature. With the newest upgrade, the bowls are now stainless steel—less chance for whisker fatigue with wide bowls or feline acne with bacteria-harboring plastic—and they're numbered, so you can easily correlate feedings to specific bowls in-app. Through the connected app, you can alter schedules, manually feed on demand, and control how long it's opened—there's even a sensor to make sure it doesn’t close while your kitty is feeding. At this price, it's well worth the money.

The Petlibro Granary automatic feeder is my personal favorite and the one I recommend for most people. Like other high-tech pet gadgets, it's controlled via an app on your phone, where you can make and adjust feeding schedules remotely, and it logs when feedings occurred. Best of all, the built-in 1080p HD camera with night vision allows you to watch and hear your pet eat even when far away, and you can communicate with them via speaker. I love checking the camera when I'm away so I can see what is going on around the bowl and how much food is left. It’s basically like a mini pet camera plus a feeder. This is the lowest price we’ve seen this year at less than $100.
Temptations
Amazon (48 oz)
Hot take: Not all cats like Churu tube treats. I bought a canister for my cats, Circe and Scylla, for Christmas last year after hearing it was our local humane society's most-requested donation (I gave them a cainster as well). The volunteers said “all cats” love it. Well, mine don't. What they do love, however, are Temptations. If you have multiple cats, or volunteer at or donate to a shelter, you know these go quickly. This Prime Day deal is for 3 pounds of the treats—plenty enough for your whole shelter or neighborhood. Or, if you just have one cat, to teach it how to perform circus acts or play the piano. —Kat Merck
Pawsync

Pawsync
This Pawsync smart feeder has a scale in the bottom of the stainless steel bowl, which makes sure your pet is getting the exact right amount of food. It'll even alter how much it dispenses based on how much is left in the bowl, ensuring your pet isn't overeating. The feeder has anti-jam technology, low food detection sensors, and a backup battery in case of power failure.
Gorilla Grip
Amazon
Feeding mats like this Gorilla Grip model are a game changer, especially for eager dogs who often spill water or knock over their food bowls. You can place this mat under pet bowls to catch debris and water for easy cleanup, and the grippy silicone helps food bowls stay in place to prevent spilling. The mat is normally a bit pricey for what it is at $20, but at half off, it’s way more affordable (and an easy hack in order to clean less).
Sofolor
Amazon
Yeah, I said it. Every cat I know loves this toy. Every cat WIRED reviewer Molly Higgins knows loves this toy. Your cat will probably love this toy. It mimics a mouselike creature running around under a blanket, an action that instinctively drives most cats bonkers, no matter how old they are. It's also motion activated, so the “mousie” will start running under the pad as soon as it senses your cat approaching. It is slightly loud, however, so make sure you're able to put it somewhere it won't bother humans. —Kat Merck

Petlibro's Dockstream Fountain is straightforward and simple to use. It has a cordless, nearly silent pump, and the basin sits on a dock with a stainless steel bowl that snaps onto the basin, both of which help to make cleaning and refilling the water easier. The basin itself holds 130 milliliters in the bowl at all times in case of power outage, and the fountain has a low-water detection system, meaning that the fountain will automatically stop if water levels get too low.

Petkit
This automatic litter box (8/10 WIRED Recommends) uses a camera and AI to monitor usage and actually lets you see your cat’s stool to help more closely monitor their health. The front arm has a camera attached, which manually and automatically tracks motion so you can see the outside and inside of the litter box (it doubles as a built-in security camera, too). It uses AI to recognize which cat used the box and takes videos so you can replay exactly what was happening inside of the box, and can even review the images of their stool to make sure nothing looks out of whack. The connected app logs and monitors usage, including the number of times used and the average duration (again, a great tool to monitor your cats' health). Now at $750, this usually pricey upgrade is the lowest price we’ll probably see this year (or at least until Black Friday).

The Petkit PuraMax 2 is what I recommend for most people. It's easy to use, compact, and, actually smells great. It cleans via vertical rotation, using a grate system to separate the waste from the clean litter. Best of all, when it's time to refill with clean litter, the box rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling.
Neakasa
Amazon

Neakasa
Chewy
The Neakasa M1 Self-Cleaning Litter Box (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great introductory automatic litter box—it has an open-top design that will be a bit more familiar for cats who are used to traditional litter boxes. There’s a lot of headroom that allows large cats to move around comfortably, and five pairs of infrared sensors and four weight sensors to detect cats for safety. Plus, it’s connected to an app where you can monitor cats' usage, habits, and adjust settings. At $380, this is the lowest price we've seen this year.
Basepaws
Amazon
Basepaws
I have a fluffy and beautiful (but dumb) dilute calico named Clover whom I've long suspected has some Maine Coon or Norwegian Forest cat in her. I tested her and found she has about 10 percent of each in her genetic makeup. Testing is super simple—they send you everything you need, and all you have to do is register your kit online, swab your cat's mouth with the provided instrument, seal the package back up, and send it to the post office. It takes about five or so weeks for results, which include important information about genetic health markers, dental conditions, ancestry, and DNA. Now on discount for $75, this kit is a great deal—not to mention a heck of a lot less expensive than a stressful trip to the vet.
Wisdom Panel
Amazon
For this at-home DNA kit, you'll just swab Fido’s mouth, send results in the prepaid package, and get insights into your dog's breed and health in just a few weeks, sent straight to your computer. The results give key findings from over 265 health tests, identify more than 365 dog breeds, and provide insights into genetics and ancestry. At a little over 100 bucks, this is a great deal to get valuable health information about your pup that can save you big money on potentially expensive vet trips down the line.
Bedsure
Amazon
Our resident mattress expert, WIRED reviewer Julia Forbes, knows a thing or two about people sleep, so it makes sense she'd have a recommendation for dog sleep as well. Her small dogs love this fuzzy, donut-shaped, extra-soft bed, and Julia herself likes that the whole thing can be thrown in the washing machine. —Kat Merck

If you're looking for a camera that's more interactive than pure surveillance, this robotic toy is a cool device at a nice price for Prime Day. The Ebo Air 2 can fire lasers, move around, provide two-way audio, and even make pet noises so you can keep your furry buddy in contact and pleasantly distracted while you hit the daily grind. We like its light and compact design that lets it move nimbly around objects in your home, while the 2K image is impressively clear. —Ryan Waniata
Tkenpro
Amazon
An intuitive camera that knows the way to your furry friend's heart, this 360-degree camera provides a clear view of your home while it distributes treats. Its suction-cupped bottom keeps the cam in place, while interactive features let you take photos, record video, talk and listen to your pet, and provide motion and even bark detection, with an app to send you notifications. The future is now, and the pet cams are cool. —Ryan Waniata
Furbo
Amazon
I just started testing this mini pet camera from Furbo, and I’m impressed. It's compact and relatively inexpensive—made even more affordable with the Prime Day discount. This little camera can be mounted for greater range, has two-way audio so you can talk to and hear your pet while away, has video recaps, and uses Furbo Nanny. Nanny is a subscription service that offers real-time alerts and smart insights and sends notifications when there’s unusual activity or emergencies. Plus, at $25, this is the lowest price I've ever seen for this smart pet cam.
Kasa
Amazon
When I'm out of the house running errands, Kasa’s camera is a godsend for keeping an eye on my little demons—I mean, angels. I get real-time alerts, night vision, and HD video to see what my dogs are up to. And if it’s something pretty funny (or bad), I can rely on the video storage to have it on record to share as evidence. —Julia Forbes
Furbo
Amazon
This popular treat-dispensing pet camera, the Furbo 360° Dog Camera (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has clear 1080p and color night-vision camera, two-way communication, noise notifications, 360-degree pan abilities, and treat dispensing. It has an additional nanny service, too, which uses algorithms to recognize your pet's behavior and send alerts if anything is out of the norm, like barking notifications and person alerts, and a time-lapse of your pet's cutest moments throughout the day.
