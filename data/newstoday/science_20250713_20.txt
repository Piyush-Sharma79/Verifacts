This Jeopardy challenge covers everything from geography and art & literature, to science, nature, food, musical instruments, and much more.

Inspired by the classic American TV game show, this flips the logic of traditional trivia. Instead of hearing a question and giving an answer, youâ€™re given a statement and must respond with a question. Weâ€™ve simplified the process: all questions are pre-written, and you simply have to complete them.

Why did I do thisâ€¦? It was stupidly easy, thatâ€™s 5 minutes I wonâ€™t be getting back ðŸ™„
I gave up after the first one.. ðŸ˜… Tried Antarctic first, then Sahara, then gave up. just missed an 'a' apparently?
The place name is Antarctica. ... The adjective is Antarctic. e.g. The Antarctic penguins...
