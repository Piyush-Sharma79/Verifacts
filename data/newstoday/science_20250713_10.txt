That luxury watch you're saving up for could be more than wrist candy if you're looking to diversify your investment portfolio.
Watch marketplace Bob's Watches published a report on Thursday that analyzed 15 years of its Rolex sales data, including over 50,000 transactions. The data shows the evolution of Rolex prices on the secondhand market, and the models that had a strong return on investment.
Several models soared in value from 2010 to 2025 — one increased over 600% during the time period, and another has a resale value of over $20,000 today.
Overall, the high-end watch market has the lowest volatility of any asset class, according to a study published in February on Social Science Research Network. Watches have a low correlation with stock market fluctuations and, depending on the model, tend to appreciate in value over time.
Some gain more value than others. Trends and fluctuating demand affect which models are bought and sold most in the pre-owned market.
The pre-owned watch market peaked between 2020 and 2022 as luxury goods became popular during the pandemic.
Rolex, one of the Big Three independent watch brands (along with Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet), has continued to fare relatively well as the pre-owned watch market has fallen from that peak.
Rolexes are "tangible assets you can wear, insure for a fraction of their value, and pass down, unlike stocks, they don't disappear at market close," Bob's Watches CEO Paul Altieri told Business Insider.
For those hunting for an investment piece, these three watches gained the most value on the pre-owned market, according to the sales data from Bob's Watches.
According to Bob's Watches, the Rolex Datejust was the most-traded collection from 2010 to 2025. Its average resale value 15 years ago was $1,150. As of May 2025, it was worth around $8,500, a 639% appreciation over the period.
The watch is down about 14% from its peak of $9,926 in March 2022. According to Bob's Watches, some of its best models include references 16013, 16233, and 69173, which refer to the code used to identify a specific model.
Altieri said the Datejust's appreciation "might surprise people who think dress watches are never as exciting as sports models," but that the watch has "broad appeal."
The Rolex Submariner has shown strong collector demand and steady appreciation in value. According to Bob's Watches, its value peaked in May 2022 at $18,889.
"We've never seen steel sports models run hotter than during" the two-year period between 2020 and 2022, Altieri said.
The average resale value of the watch dipped in 2023 but has been recovering, according to the data, and is now worth $17,295.
"The Submariner data shows this wasn't just hype," he said.
Bob's Watches said its best-selling models include references 16610, 116610, and 16613.
Bob Watches found that the value of GMT-Master II Rolex models has risen 506% since 2010, reflecting demand for vintage Pepsi and modern Batman models named for their unique colors. The sales data show steady growth from 2010 to 2017, before peaking at $23,992 in November 2021.
As of 2025, its resale value is $20,595, showing its resilience in the pre-owned market. Some of the best-selling models on Bob's Watches include references 116710 — known as the Batman— and 16710, which are the classic Pepsi or Coke watches.
"It's not just its 24-hour bezel — it's the stories behind every red-and-blue 'Pepsi' or black-and-blue 'Batman' edition that fuel its collectibility and price momentum," Altieri said.
