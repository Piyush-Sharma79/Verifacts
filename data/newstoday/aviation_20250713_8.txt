Emergency crews spent an hour searching the Hudson River near Pier 40 on Thursday evening after a witness reported seeing a man jump into the water, the FDNY said.
Authorities said they received a 911 call around 6:30 p.m. about a possible water emergency near 353 West St., between West Houston and Clarkson streets.
FDNY Assistant Chief Kevin Brennan said firefighters arrived within four minutes and deployed divers and rescue swimmers, alongside NYPD units, including harbor and aviation teams.
“There was a witness here … who said she saw a gentleman, unknown age, jump into the water,” Brennan said during a press conference. “We searched for about an hour and we were unable to locate the victim.”
Crews also searched north of the pier, in case the current had carried the man up the shoreline, according to the FDNY. Brennan said conditions were challenging due to strong tides and all searches were ultimately negative.
Officials have not identified the man.
The FDNY said it has since concluded operations.
“It's dangerous water, the river here,” Brennan warned. “Surely, you don’t want to jump in. If you’re in a boat, you should have a life preserver on at all times.”
The NYPD said the investigation remains ongoing.
